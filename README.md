## Motivation
Given that the vast majority of Puerto Rican high school graduates that pursue a higher education do so in 
the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) system, I thought it would be nice for a potential applicant to get an idea 
of what it would take for her to get admitted to a given campus, in terms of GPA and IGS. The target audience 
is a student in the ninth or tenth grade that wants to starts shaping her plans for the not-too-distant future.

## Data source
The data was obtained from [Portal de Interconexión de Datos Abiertos de Puerto Rico]
(https://data.pr.gov/en/Educaci-n/Admitidos-a-la-Universidad-de-Puerto-Rico-desde-20/uaij-e68c#column-menu).
It consists of approximately 70,000 records of admitted students to the UPR system from 2009 to 2013.
